# LL: Remove Duplicates (Interview Question)

## 📝 Statement
You are given a singly linked list that contains integer values, where some of these values may be duplicated.


📌 **Note:** this linked list class does NOT have a tail which will make this method easier to implement.


Your task is to implement a method called removeDuplicates() within the LinkedList class that removes all duplicate values from the list.

Your method should not create a new list, but rather modify the existing list in-place, preserving the relative order of the nodes.

## 🔍 Example:

### Example 1:

    Example:

    Input:

    LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5

    Output:

    LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5


## 🚀 Method signature:

```java
public void removeDuplicates();
